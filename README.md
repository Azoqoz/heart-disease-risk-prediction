## Overview

AI Investment Opportunity Analyzer is an end-to-end machine learning application that simulates how investment opportunities can be evaluated through a structured scoring and recommendation workflow.

The system analyzes financial, market, strategic, risk, sustainability, sector, and regional factors to estimate an Investment Score between 0 and 100.

The predicted score is converted into one of three recommendation categories:

- **Invest**
- **Review**
- **Reject**

The project covers the complete machine learning lifecycle, including synthetic data generation, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, preprocessing, model comparison, explainability, prediction, and interactive dashboard development.

## Important Disclaimer

> [!WARNING]
> This project uses a fully synthetic dataset created for educational and portfolio purposes.
>
> It does not use real investment data and must not be treated as financial advice or used for real investment decisions without validated data, domain-expert review, governance, and additional testing.

## Machine Learning Workflow

### 1. Synthetic Data Generation

The project generates 5,000 synthetic investment-opportunity records.

The dataset includes information related to:

- Financial performance
- Investment size
- Capital and operating costs
- Expected ROI
- Internal rate of return
- Net present value
- Payback period
- Market size and growth
- Customer demand and adoption
- Strategic alignment
- Risk indicators
- Sustainability and ESG
- Sector
- Region
- Competition level

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset is explored through:

- Summary statistics
- Investment-score distributions
- Recommendation distributions
- Sector comparisons
- Region comparisons
- Correlation analysis
- Risk-versus-score comparisons
- ROI-versus-score comparisons
- Strategic-impact analysis

### 3. Feature Engineering

The project creates additional decision-support features, including:

- Overall risk score
- Strategic impact score
- Sustainability score
- Market attractiveness score
- Financial strength score
- Risk-adjusted ROI
- Profitability index
- Payback efficiency

### 4. Data Preprocessing

Numerical features are standardized using:

```text
StandardScaler
```

Categorical features are encoded using:

```text
OneHotEncoder
```

The transformations are stored in a fitted preprocessing pipeline and reused during inference.

### 5. Model Training

The machine learning task is formulated as a regression problem.

The target variable is:

```text
Investment Score: 0–100
```

Multiple regression algorithms are trained and compared.

### 6. Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using:

- Mean Absolute Error
- Root Mean Squared Error
- R² Score

The model with the lowest Mean Absolute Error is selected.

### 7. Prediction

The selected model predicts an Investment Score, which is limited to remain between 0 and 100.

### 8. Recommendation Generation

The predicted score is converted into an Invest, Review, or Reject recommendation.

### 9. Explainability

For each prediction, the application calculates feature contributions using the processed feature values and the Ridge Regression coefficients.

This allows the dashboard to display which factors increased or decreased the predicted Investment Score.

## Models Compared

The following regression models were evaluated:

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Extra Trees Regressor

The recorded model-comparison results are:

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R² |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Ridge Regression | 7.3260 | 9.3381 | 0.8394 |
| Linear Regression | 7.3466 | 9.3661 | 0.8384 |
| Gradient Boosting | 8.0693 | 10.1460 | 0.8104 |
| Extra Trees | 8.7917 | 11.0306 | 0.7759 |
| Random Forest | 8.8311 | 11.0148 | 0.7765 |

---

## Selected Model

The selected model is:

```text
Ridge Regression
```

Ridge Regression achieved the lowest Mean Absolute Error in the recorded model comparison:

```text
MAE  = 7.3260
RMSE = 9.3381
R²   = 0.8394
```

Ridge Regression also supports coefficient-based feature contribution analysis, allowing the application to explain the direction and approximate impact of individual processed features.

---

## Recommendation Logic

The predicted Investment Score is mapped to a recommendation using the following thresholds:

| Score Range | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| 75–100 | Invest |
| 45–74.99 | Review |
| Below 45 | Reject |

The implemented logic is:

```python
if score >= 75:
    recommendation = "Invest"
elif score >= 45:
    recommendation = "Review"
else:
    recommendation = "Reject"
```

These thresholds are project-defined decision rules created for the synthetic portfolio scenario. They are not validated financial standards.

---

## Prediction Explainability

The application explains Ridge Regression predictions using local feature contributions.

For each processed feature:

```text
Feature Contribution =
Processed Feature Value × Model Coefficient
```

Positive contributions increase the predicted Investment Score, while negative contributions reduce it.

The dashboard displays:

- Top contributing features
- Positive score drivers
- Negative score drivers
- Contribution direction
- Contribution magnitude
- Feature-contribution visualization

This provides a more transparent prediction experience than displaying a score without supporting information.

## Current Limitations

- The dataset is entirely synthetic
- The model has not been validated using real investment outcomes
- Recommendation thresholds are manually defined project rules
- The model may reproduce assumptions embedded in the synthetic data-generation process
- Simplified dashboard inputs generate additional model features using predefined mappings, formulas, medians, and modes
- Coefficient-based explanations describe the Ridge Regression model but do not establish causation
- The dashboard does not include real-time financial or market data
- The application does not include authentication or saved user sessions
- The current results do not demonstrate performance on a real production distribution
- The system should not replace financial analysis, due diligence, or expert judgment

---
